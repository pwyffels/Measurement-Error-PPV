## this script contains the code for the 3 models used in the manuscript.
# These bayesians models are extensions from the methods published by Patrick Taff√© 
# and incorporated in the MethodCompare-package
# Each model determines the precision for each distinct method of handling PPmax and PPmin 
# for 5 distinct observation windows
# for more details see the manuscript.
